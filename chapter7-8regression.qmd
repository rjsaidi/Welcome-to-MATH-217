# Chapter 7 Intro to Linear Regression

Work with the possum data found in the OpenIntro datasets

![Hanging baby possum: <https://www.scenichudson.org/viewfinder/the-opossum-a-surprising-n-y-fan-fave/>](Fall 2023/possum_hanging.JPG){fig-alt="https://www.scenichudson.org/viewfinder/the-opossum-a-surprising-n-y-fan-fave/" width="285"}

## Load tidyverse, set the working directory, and read in the possum data

```{r message = FALSE, warning =FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
setwd("C:/Users/rsaidi/Dropbox/Rachel/MontColl/Datasets/Datasets")
possum <- read_csv("possum_openintro.csv")
```

## Explore the possum dataset variables

note that there are 104 observations with 8 variables.
All variables are quantitative except "pop"

```{r}
head(possum)
```

## Create a scatterplot of head length to total body length

```{r}
ggplot(possum, aes(x=head_l, y=total_l))+
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()+
  labs(x="Possum Head Length (cm)", 
       y="Possum Total Body Length (cm)",
       title = "Scatterplot of Possum Head to Total Body Length",
       caption = "Source: Lindenmayer, D. B. et al, 1995. Australian Journal of Zoology 43")
```

We can see a positive association: as head length increases, total body length tends to increase as well.

## Create a linear model to show this association

lm stands for linear model.
The linear model form is: y \~ x

```{r}
fit1 <- lm(data = possum, total_l ~ head_l) 
summary(fit1)
```

We can see that this linear equation is:

y-hat = mx + b total_l = 0.8337(head_l)+ 9.8882

• This means that for each additional cm increase in head length, the total body length increases by 0.8337 cm.
• The y-intercept is 9.8882 cm, meaning that when the head length is 0 cm, the total body length is 9.8882 cm.
• The p-value for head_l to predict total_l is very small, and therefore head_l is an important predictor of total_l.
• The p-value for the overall model is very small, so the model is meaningful.
• Finally, the adjusted R\^2 is .4725.
We will discuss the meaning of this value below.

## Adjusted

$R^2$

**The adjusted** $R^2$ value may be interpreted as follows:

**\_\_\_\_% of the variation in the observations may be explained by this model.**

*For this model, 47% of the variation in the observations may be explained by this model.*

## Show the linear regression line on the scatterplot

```{r}
ggplot(possum, aes(x=head_l, y=total_l))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  theme_bw()+
  labs(x="Possum Head Length (cm)", 
       y="Possum Total Body Length (cm)",
       title = "Scatterplot of Possum Head to Total Body Length",
       caption = "Source: Lindenmayer, D. B. et al, 1995. Australian Journal of Zoology 43")
```

## The Gray Band

The gray area around the linear regression line is the standard error (se) band.
We can remove it with: "se = FALSE"

```{r}
ggplot(possum, aes(x=head_l, y=total_l))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  theme_bw()+
  labs(x="Possum Head Length (cm)", 
       y="Possum Total Body Length (cm)",
       title = "Scatterplot of Possum Head to Total Body Length",
       caption = "Source: Lindenmayer, D. B. et al, 1995. Australian Journal of Zoology 43")
```

## What if the relationships are different between male and female possums?

Add color and shape for the sex to distinguish males and females (sex is a categorical variable)

```{r}
ggplot(possum, aes(x=head_l, y=total_l, color = sex))+
  geom_point(aes(shape = sex)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  theme_bw()+
  labs(x="Possum Head Length (cm)", 
       y="Possum Total Body Length (cm)",
       title = "Scatterplot of Possum Head to Total Body Length",
       caption = "Source: Lindenmayer, D. B. et al, 1995. Australian Journal of Zoology 43")
```

We can explore the values for the equation of this more complex plot, but just looking at the lines, the female line has a much steeper slope, indicating that as female head length increase, there is a much greater female total body length increase than for males.

## Explore how age is associated with the two variables

Add color by age (which is a quantitative variable).
Add alpha (the level of transparency).
Alpha values go between zero and 1.
Values closer to zero are MORE transparent.

```{r}
ggplot(possum, aes(x=head_l, y=total_l))+
  geom_point(aes(color = age),alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "green",high = "purple",)+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  theme_bw()+
  labs(x="Possum Head Length (cm)", 
       y="Possum Total Body Length (cm)",
       title = "Scatterplot of Possum Head to Total Body Length",
       caption = "Source: Lindenmayer, D. B. et al, 1995. Australian Journal of Zoology 43")
```

## Finally, plot the residuals

```{r}
ggplot(data = fit1,  aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "red", linewidth = 1.5) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x="Linear Model Fitted Values", y="Model Residual Values",
       title = "Residuals to Fitted Values for Linear Regression Model")
```

## What does this residuals plot show?

The residuals plot should show points scattered in no particular pattern about the horizontal line at y=0.

## Visualizing parallel slopes models

Three variables, one plot

In this scatterplot, we use color to differentiate the possums age 3 from age 6.

In this manner, we have depicted three variables---two numeric and one categorical---on the same scatterplot.
Thus, this plot will enable us to visualize our parallel slopes model in the data space.

```{r}
newdata <- possum |>
  filter(age %in% c(3, 6))

plotage1 <- ggplot(data = newdata, aes(
  x = head_l, y = total_l, color = factor(age))) + 
  geom_point()
plotage1
```

## Create the linear model

```{r}
mod <- lm(total_l ~ head_l + factor(age), data = newdata)
summary(mod)
```

## Our model is:

total_length =β_0 + β_1(head_length) + β_2(age_6)

total_length =6.5115 + 0.8778(head_length) + 0.9437(age_6)

## Now use the function, augment, to provide a detailed statistical summary of the model values including the fitted y-values and the residuals.

```{r}
augment(mod)
```

## Now plot the parallel slopes for ages 3 and 6

```{r}
plotage2 <- ggplot(data = newdata, aes(
  x = head_l, y = total_l, color = factor(age))) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(data = augment(mod), aes(y = .fitted, color = `factor(age)`))
plotage2
```

## Using categorical predictors with only 2 factors

What if we only wanted to predict total body length of the possums based on sex?
We can use what is know as a "dummy variable" - a categorical variable - as a predictor of total body length.

```{r}
ggplot(possum, aes(x=sex, y=total_l))+
  geom_point()+
   theme_bw()+
  labs(x="Possum Sex", 
       y="Possum Total Body Length (cm)",
       title = "Scatterplot of Possum Sex to Total Body Length",
       caption = "Source: Lindenmayer, D. B. et al, 1995. Australian Journal of Zoology 43")
```

## You might be surprised, but we can create a linear model of this relationship

Create the linear model using sex and total body length

```{r}
fit2 <- lm(data = possum, total_l ~ sex)
summary(fit2)
```

## What happened in this model?

Notice that the model ONLY SHOWS sexm, meaning the male slope.
This means that because female is alphabetically before males, R coded females as zeros and males as ones.
sex_f (females): the slope for female relationship to body length is embedded in the intercept.
This is called a **reference level.**

This also means that, because the male slope is negative, males total body length decreases by 1.4 cm as compared to female body length.

## Visualize this with a plot and linear regression line

Recode sex such that male = 1 and female = 0

```{r}
possum$sex2<-ifelse(possum$sex=="m", 1, 0)
```

```{r}
ggplot(possum, aes(x=sex2, y=total_l))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)+
   theme_bw()+
  labs(x="Possum Sex", 
       y="Possum Total Body Length (cm)",
       title = "Scatterplot of Possum Sex to Total Body Length",
       caption = "Source: Lindenmayer, D. B. et al, 1995. Australian Journal of Zoology 43")
```

Ignoring head length and only using sex as a predictor, males overall have shorter body lengths than females.

**What is very important to notice, is that one single variable cannot possibly completely explain a possum's total body length. Therefore, in Chapter 8, we will explore multiple factors causing a response variable.**

# Chapter 8 - Multiple Linear Regression

## Continue with Possum Dataset

```{r}
head(possum)
```

## Explore the variables in the dataset

```{r}
names(possum)
```

There are only two types - "Vic" and "other"

## Predict total body length based on all variables in the dataset (excluding total_l):

"site" "pop" "sex" "age" "head_l" "skull_w" "tail_l" "sex2"

## Explore the quantitative variables to determine if any correlation

Use a correlation plot to explore the correlation among all variables.
This correlation plot shows pairwise results, but in a heatmap of correlation values.

```{r}
#install.packages("GGally")
library(GGally)
#remove na values from age
possum2 <- possum %>% filter(!is.na(age))
ggpairs(possum2, c("age","head_l","skull_w","tail_l" ))
```

## What does this matrix of plots show?

When creating multiple regression models, we have to ensure there is no **collinearity**

### Collinearity

The key goal of multiple regression analysis is to isolate the relationship between EACH INDEPENDENT VARIABLE and the DEPENDENT VARIABLE. COLLINEARITY means explanatory variables **are correlated** and thus NOT INDEPENDENT. The more correlated the variables, the more difficult it is to change one variable without changing the other.
This is important to keep in mind.
The two different matrices gave slightly different correlation information.
We are concerned with dependence of 2 or more variables.

We can see that head length is strongly correlated with skull width, which is not surprising.
Therefore, we would **NOT** want to include both variables in the final model.
We will decide which to exclude soon.

## Start with a "full model" of predictors for the total body length

With multiple regression, there are several strategies for comparing variable inputs into a model.
I will show you backward elimination.
In backward elimination, start with all possible predictor variables with your response variable.
In this case, we will use: site + pop + sex + age + head_l + skull_w + tail_l

Perform a model fit with all predictors.

1.  Look at the p-value for each variable - if it is relatively small ( \< 0.10), then it is likely contributing to the model.

2.  Look at the output for the Adjusted R-Squared value at the bottom of the output.
    The interpretation is: \_\_% (from the adjusted r-squared value) of the variation in the observations may be explained by this model.
    The higher the adjusted R-squared value, the better the model.
    We use the adjusted R-squared value because it compensates for more predictors mathematically increasing the normal R-squared value.

3.  Check out the residual plots (we will do this in the second chunk below).

```{r}
full_model <- lm(data = possum, total_l ~ site + pop + sex + age + head_l + skull_w + tail_l)
summary(full_model)
```

## What does this mean?

Look at the p-values to find which variables are **LEAST** significant.
Age, population, and skull width seem least useful.
Also look at the adjusted R-squared value: 0.7506.
This means approximately 75% of the variation in the observations may be explained by this model.
It is a good value, but we can possibly improve it.

## Now look at the diagnostic plots

```{r}
#install.packages("ggfortify")
library(ggfortify)  # this will run the autoplot function
autoplot(full_model, nrow=2, ncol=2)
```

## What do the diagnostic plots mean?

1.  Residual plot essentially indicates whether a linear model is appropriate - you can see this by the blue line showing relatively horizontal.
    If it is not relatively horizontal, a linear plot may not be appropriate.

2.  QQPlot indicates whether the distribution is relatively normal.
    Observations that might be outliers are indicated by their row number.

3.  Scale-Location indicates homogeneous variance (homoscedasticity).
    Influential observations that are skewing the variance distribution are indicated.

4.  Cook's Distance indicates which outliers have high leverage, meaning that some outliers may not cause the model to violate basic assumptions required for the regression analysis (see #1-3).
    If outliers have high leverage, then they may be causing problems for your model.
    You can try to remove those observations, especially if they appear in any of the other 3 plots above.

**Generally, this model's diagnostic plots all indicate the model is pretty good. We will work to improve it now.**

## Simplfy the model

We will remove "age" from the model, rerun it, and then check the 3 indicators: p-values, Adj R-Squared, and diagnostic plots

```{r}
full_2 <- lm(data = possum2, total_l ~ site + pop + sex + head_l + skull_w + tail_l)
summary(full_2)
autoplot(full_2, nrow=2, ncol=2)
```

## Simplify further - remove pop and skull_w (esp since skull_w is collinear to head_l)

```{r}
full_3 <- lm(data = possum2, total_l ~ site + sex + head_l + tail_l)
summary(full_3)
```

## Parsimony

This model may be the simplest form (parsimonious).
We can try one more time to remove "sex" from the model and check the adj r-squared, which is already improved to 75.7%.

```{r}
full_4 <- lm(data = possum2, total_l ~ site + head_l + tail_l)
summary(full_4)
```

Because the adj r-squared decreased, this suggests the model is better with sex included.

Therefore **full_3** would be the likely best model.
